# AngularJS_Playbook - Frontend with simple registration form #


Last week I faced a problem on my current project.  
Due to this I had to learn basics of angularJS.

*AngularJS was a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework  
for developing single-page applications. It was maintained mainly  
by Google and a community of individuals and corporations.*
